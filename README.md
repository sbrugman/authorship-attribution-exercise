# Exercise on Authorship Attribution
Assignment on authorship attribution created for the course Text and Multimedia Mining, Radboud University, Nijmegen.

The file `authorship.py` provides a template with steps that are commonly used for training and evaluating of a classifier.
The feature extraction phase is left out. Can you train and evaluate a reliable classifier for authorship attribution?

If you think this code can help you in another project, for example another classification task, feel free to (re)use it.


## Installation
The code is build for Python 3. You can install the packages used with `pip`. I.e. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
